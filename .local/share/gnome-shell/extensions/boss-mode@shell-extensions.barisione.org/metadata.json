  "description": "Disable or enable notifications with the keyboard.\n\nGnome Shell has a built-in feature in the user menu to disable all notifications, but you need to open the menu and click it. Moreover, a notification is shown when you turn notifications off. This behaviour makes it quite useless if you just want some privacy when somebody walks by your desk. With this extension you can disable notifications with your keyboard and no visual feedback is given, so you can get your privacy without making it clear to the person next to you.\n\n\u201cWindows key + B\u201d turns notifications off, \u201cWindows key + N\u201d turns them on again. You can change this setting clicking the settings icon on this page; there you can also set a keybiding for toggling notifications if that's what you prefer.",
